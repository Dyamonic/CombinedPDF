## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyMuPDF (imported as `fitz`)
- pypdf

Install via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Dyamonic/CombinedPDF.git
cd CombinedPDF

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python app.py
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Combine reports, statements, or forms in a set order
- Preview multi‑page PDFs with responsive zoom and scrolling
- Rapidly export merged documents with minimal clicks

## 📝 Notes

- Preview uses raster rendering; very large PDFs can take time/memory
- When merging, the resulting order is strictly: PDF 2 pages followed by PDF 1 pages
- The app auto‑generates a simple icon into `assets/` on first run
